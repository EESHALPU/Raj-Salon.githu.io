He is the man behind growth and expansion of the company. Mr. Dutta while working on the design and interiors for the salon keeps in mind "Utmost Luxury at Affordable Prices" to ensure the customers get the maximum and beyond expectations. Mr. Dutta says, "I started the salon chain from a small 3 cutting station barber shop and guided the company through the stages – from Barber shop to Beauty Parlor and now 118+ unisex salons across Delhi, NCR and North & Central India".<h1 align=center>Design and Concept</h1>The salon interiors are inspired from abstract and defined lines; giving the salon a very modern, plush and stylish look. The inspiration for the salon interiors comes mostly from the needs expressed by the growing awareness and more informed consumers.

While setting up the salon, Mr. Dutta faced typical challenges that come from a very fast growing and radically changing industry. With the consumers being more informed and aware; we had to ensure that we live to the perception of ultimate in luxury yet affordable as per mindset of customers.<P The latest yet the most modern and luxurious had to be sourced and none other than the best – Tangy Rose was chosen. Mr. Dutta says" While setting and designing a new salon I put myself in place of the consumer and then feel and relate with before choosing or selecting.</P></td>
